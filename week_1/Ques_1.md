# B. Another Divisibility Problem

**Time limit per test:** 1 second  
**Memory limit per test:** 256 megabytes  

## Problem Description

Alice and Bob are playing a game in which Alice has given Bob a positive integer $x < 10^8$.

To win the game, Bob has to find another positive integer $y < 10^9$ such that $x \, \# \, y$ is divisible by $x + y$.

Here $x \, \# \, y$ denotes the integer formed by **concatenating** the integers $x$ and $y$ in that order. For example, if $x = 835, y = 47$, then $x \, \# \, y = 83547$.

However, since Bob is dumb, he is unable to find such an integer. Please help him.

It can be shown that such an integer always exists.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \le x < 10^8$) — the integer that Alice has given to Bob.

## Output

For each test case, print a single integer $y$ ($1 \le y < 10^9$) so that Bob can win the game.

If there are multiple answers, print any one of them.
